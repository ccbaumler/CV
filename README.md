# My CV

My Data Driven CV written with R, YAML, LaTeX, and Github Actions.

This CV repository may be updated here on GitHub or locally once pulled. Update
by modifying the `CV` rmarkdown file and/or the `data` r file located in the 
`CV` directory. Also within the `CV` directory is the final output, the `CV` pdf
file. This CV is using a slightly customized `awesome-cv` latex cls file as a template.
