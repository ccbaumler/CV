# My Data Driven CV written with R, YAML, LaTeX, and Github Actions.

This CV repository may be updated here on GitHub or locally once pulled. Update
by modifying:

1. the `awesome-cv` RMarkdown file in `scripts/` for any format changes to the document
2. the `data` r file in `data/` for new information in the document

Also, within the `docs/` directory is the final output, the `awesome-cv.pdf` pdf
file. This CV is using a slightly customized `awesome-cv` latex cls file as a template (this may be found in `scripts/`).
